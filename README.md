# ALSA-only-Jack-Archlinux-Audio-Config
Here I like to share my realtime audio configuration on a (pulseaudio-free) Archlinux system. I use a Lenovo laptop with Intel chipset and a Presonus AudioBox VSL. My configuration is not perfect and lacks some functions. But this is due to some missing configurations. Actually I have a fully functional Alsa-Jack-Loopback-System which also works in the garden where I do not have the USB audiobox.
